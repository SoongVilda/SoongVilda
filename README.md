# My personality
I like open-source, linux, and tech stuff in general. I also enjoy helping people in the open-source community. Don't worry about contacting me if you need anything. I'm friendly, positive, and open to meeting new people.

## :penguin: GNU/Linux
I'm a power user of GNU/Linux. Arch Wiki taught me a lot, and I continue learning new stuff. Sometimes I visit Gentoo wiki - when Arch Wiki doesn't give me an answer. <br>

## My work
Here is a list of my work or project in which I participate.

- [linux-cachyos](https://github.com/CachyOS/linux-cachyos/blob/master/README.md) - I redesigned the page for the kernel used by **CachyOS**.
- [Native compiling Arch Linux packages](https://github.com/SoongVilda/archilinux_native_compiling) - Script helps me build a lot of packages native for my hardware - CPU.
- [Guides for NVIDIA laptops](https://wiki.cachyos.org/en/notebooks) - People around me had issues with NVIDIA laptops, so I decided to help them, and that's why I wrote this guide.
- [Guide for KVM](https://github.com/SoongVilda/archlinux-virtualization-KVM) I use KVM a lot for testing. 
- [ZRAM script](https://github.com/SoongVilda/zram-config) - 8GB RAM is a pain. My lovely Warframe crashes on open maps, so I compressed RAM.

## Only Arch Linux?
I'm also familiar with the following distributions
- Fedora, CentOS (RHEL-based).
- Ubuntu/Debian-based - I used PopOS, Ubuntu, Kubuntu.

### Security
I know that's boring, but it an important.
- Password manager, encryption is my friend.

### TL;DR
- Docs writer
- Bash scripter
- Community tech support.
- Virtualization KVM, VirtualBox
- Packager for Arch-based distribution.
